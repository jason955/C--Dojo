### Chapter 4. Basic Declarations and Expressions
Exercise 4-1:Write a program  to print your name, Social Security number, and date of birth. 
Exercise 4-2: Write a program to print a block E using asterisks (*), where the E is 7 characters high and 5 characters wide.
Exercise 4-3: Write a program to compute the area and circumference of a rectangle 3 inches wide by 5 inches long. What changes must be made to the program so it works for a rectangle 6.8 inches wide by 2.3 inches long? 
Exercise 4-4: Write a program to print "HELLO" in big block letters where each letter is 7 characters high and 5 characters wide.
### Chapter 5. Arrays, Qualifiers, and Reading Numbers
Exercise 5-1: Write a program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit. F = 9/5 C+32 
Exercise 5-2: Write a program to calculate the volume of a sphere, 4/3Ï€r3. 
Exercise 5-3: Write a program to print out the perimeter of a rectangle given its height and width. perimeter = 2 (width+height) 
Exercise 5-4: Write a program that converts kilometers per hour to miles per hour. miles = (kilometers -0.6213712) 
Exercise 5-5: Write a program that takes hours and minutes as input and outputs the total number of minutes ( 1 hour 30 minutes = 90 minutes). 
Exercise 5-6: Write a program that takes an integer as the number of minutes and outputs the total hours and minutes (90 minutes = 1 hour 30 minutes).
### Chapter 6. Decision and Control Statements
Exercise 6-1: Write a program  to find the square of the distance between two points. Find the distance only if you want to do the independent research needed to perform a square root in C++. 
Exercise 6-2: A professor generates letter grades using Table 6-3. 
	Table 6-3 Grade Values % Correct Grade 0-60 F 61-70 D 71-80 C 81-90 B 91-100 A Given a numeric grade, print the letter. 
Exercise 6-3: Modify the previous program to print out a + or - after the letter grade based on the last digit of the score. The modifiers are listed in Table 6-4. 
	Table 6-4 Grade-Modification Values Last digit Modifier 1-34-7 <blank> 8-0 + For example, 81=B-, 94=A, and 68=D+. Note: An F is only an F. There is no F+ or F-. NOTE Programmers frequently have to modify code that someone else wrote. A good exercise is to take someone else's Exercise 6-2 and modify it.
Exercise 6-4: Given an amount (less than $1.00), compute the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies needed.
Exercise 6-5: A leap year is any year divisible by 4 unless it is divisible by 100, but not 400. Write a program to tell whether a year is a leap year.
